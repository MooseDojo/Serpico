      Hi!
      %br
      Here is a current list of findings from the assessment and the risk rating:
      %br
      - @findings.each do |finding|
        %br
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#{finding.title} - 
        - if @dread
          DREAD Score: #{finding.dread_total}
        - elsif @cvss
          CVSS Score: #{finding.cvss_total}
        - else
          - risk_t = ["Informational","Low","Moderate","High","Critical"]
          - if finding.risk
            #{risk_t[finding.risk]}
          - else
            - scr = finding.dread_total/10
            #{risk_t[scr]}
    - else
      This is going to be a short status update as you don't have any findings associated with this project.
